# scFly
Single-cell sequencing methods enables measurement of cells' molecular states at single cell resolution. One problem arised along with the new data is mapping common/similar cells across different measurements. Our ***scFly*** efficiently maps cells across different datasets with locality sensitive hashing, which is resistent to common single-cell omics noises or biases like dropout events and batch effects.
